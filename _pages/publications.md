<p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> Magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) is a novel reliable technique with excellent potential for thermal therapies and treating breast tumours. This method involves injecting a magnetic nanofluid into the tumour and applying an external AC magnetic field to induce heat in the magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and raise the tumour temperature to ablation temperature ranges. Because of the complexity of considering and coupling all different physics involves in this phenomenon and also due to the intricacy of a thorough FEM numerical study, few FEM-based studies address the entire MFH process as similar to reality as possible. The current study investigates a FEM-based three-dimensional numerical simulation of MFH of breast tumours as a multi-physics problem. An anatomically realistic breast phantom (ARBP) is considered, some magnetic nanofluid is injected inside the tumour, and the diffusion phenomenon is simulated. Then, the amount of heat generated in the MNP-saturated tumour area due to an external AC magnetic field is simulated. In the end, the fraction of tumour tissue necrotized by this temperature rise is evaluated. The study’s results demonstrate that by injecting nanofluid and utilizing seven circular copper windings with each coil carrying 400 A current with a frequency of 400 kHz for generating the external AC magnetic field, the temperature in tumour tissue can be raised to a maximum of about 51.4°C, which leads to necrosis of entire tumour tissue after 30 minutes of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure. This numerical platform can depict all four various physics involved in the MFH of breast tumours by numerically solving all different equation sets coupled together with high precision. Thus, the proposed model can be utilized by clinicians as a reliable tool for predicting and identifying the approximate amount of temperature rise and the necrotic fraction of breast tumour, which can be very useful to opt for the best MFH therapeutic procedure and conditions based on various patients. In future works, this numerical platform’s results should be compared with experimental in-vivo results to improve and modify this platform in order to be ready for clinical applications.</p></span></ul>

<p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> The development of refrigeration systems using thermo-acoustic technology is a novel solution for achieving environmentally friendly refrigerators. A full transient CFD method is introduced here that can resemble the whole thermo-acoustic phenomena along with its different governing physics as a whole. The working fluid contributes critically to the thermo-acoustic refrigerators’ cooling performance. In this paper, unlike previous researches, all different possible combinations of noble gases are considered and the performance of the refrigerator from both aspects of cooling temperature and COPR are investigated to determine the optimized gas mixture among all combinations. For this purpose, the effect of the sound intensity and the fluid’s Prandtl number as two key factors are investigated on the refrigeration performance. By considering a 2D-axisymmetric computational geometry resembling the real model, it is tried to attain results as reliable as possible. COMSOL software is used to perform the simulations. It is concluded that from the aspect of the cooling temperature, a sample with the highest sound intensity (pure He sample in this research) is the best. But, from the aspect of a higher COPR (relative coefficient of performance), a sample with the lowest Pr number (72%He–28%Xe sample in this research) would be the best. The lowest cooling temperature which is achieved by the pure He sample was about 273 K and the highest COPR which belongs to 72%He–28%Xe sample was approximately 0.335.</p></span></ul>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> This paper considers the inverse problem under hyperspectral images (HSIs) denoising framework. Recently, it has been shown that deep learning is a promising approach to image denoising. However, deep learning to be effective usually needs a massive amount of training data. Moreover, in a practical scenario, HSIs may get contaminated by different kinds of noises such as Gaussian and/or sparse noise. Lately, it has been reported that the convolutional neural network (CNN), the core element used by deep image prior (DIP), is able to capture image statistical characteristics without the need of training, i.e., restore the clean image blindly. Nonetheless, there exists some performance gap between DIP and state-of-the-art methods in HSIs (e.g., low-rank models). By applying the Huber loss function (HLF), which is derived through a least favorable distribution in robust statistics, to DIP, we propose a novel unsupervised denoising algorithm, referred as to the HLF-DIP, free from pre-training and without involving any regularizer. Extensive experimental results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed HLF-DIP algorithm significantly outperforms seven state-of-the-art algorithms in both complexity (thanks to no regularization) and robustness against complex noise (e.g., mixed types of noises).</p></span></ul>
