<h1 class="post-title">About me</h1>
</header>

<p> I received my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Guilan in 2019. My senior year project was based on signal processing and communications system issues related to "optical wireless communications" under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cNXH4oIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="\_blank" style="color: #B509AC">  Prof. Gholamreza Baghersalimi</a>. <br> <br> 

 
In 2020, I was accepted by the Institute of Communications Engineering in the National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) for an M.S. degree with a full scholarship (A merit-based scholarship to provide funding and to cover living costs and tuition fees for selected graduate students). Then, I joined the "Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP) Lab" to pursue my master's degree under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=QzDAeT8AAAAJ&hl=en" target="\_blank" style="color: #B509AC">  Prof. Chong-Yung Chi</a>. (IEEE Fellow) in Fall 2020. <br> <br>
