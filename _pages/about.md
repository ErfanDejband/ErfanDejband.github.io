</header>

<p> I am currently an M.Sc. student in the College of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the National Tsing Hua University. I joined the Wireless Communications & Signal Processing (WCSP) under supervision of under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=QzDAeT8AAAAJ&hl=en" target="\_blank" style="color: #B509AC">  Prof. Chong-Yung Chi</a>. (IEEE Fellow) in Fall 2020. My research interests lie primarily in convex optimization, machine learning, signal processing and inverse problems, with applications in hyperspectral and medical imaging. <br> <br>
  
  I received my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Guilan in 2019. My senior year project was based on signal processing and communications system issues related to "optical wireless communications" under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cNXH4oIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="\_blank" style="color: #B509AC">  Prof. Gholamreza Baghersalimi</a>. <br> <br>
